App Name: Feastly

Description:
Feastly is a feature-rich iOS application designed with modern technologies to provide a seamless and secure user experience. Leveraging the power of SwiftUI, MVVM architecture, and UserDefaults for persistent data storage, Feastly ensures a robust, elegant, and efficient user experience.

Key Technologies and Design Patterns Used:

SwiftUI

Feastly utilizes SwiftUI, Appleâ€™s declarative framework, to build a clean, intuitive, and visually appealing user interface.
Features such as Form, DatePicker, NavigationStack, and TabView are used to deliver a smooth, modern app experience.
MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) Architecture

The app follows the MVVM design pattern to maintain a clean and scalable codebase.
Separation of concerns ensures the UI (View) remains independent of the business logic (ViewModel), making the app easier to test and maintain.
UserDefaults

Persistent storage of user data is achieved through UserDefaults, ensuring that information like usernames, passwords, and birthdays is securely stored and retained even after the app is closed.
UserDefaults provides an efficient and lightweight solution for saving simple app data locally.
